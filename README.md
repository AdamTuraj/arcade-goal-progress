# Arcade Progress Calculator

A very simple NextJS app which calculates some info given your goal (in # of tickets) and the amount of tickets you already have.
It calculates the following info:

- Percentage to goal
- Percentage through event
- How many hours you'd have to do every day to reach the goal

The final value assumes all sessions are accepted.

To run locally run the following commands:

```
yarn install
```

Then to start the app:

```
yarn dev
```
